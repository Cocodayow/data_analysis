# Real data analysis project
This is a group project done in August 2023. In this project, we do data cleaning, statistical analysis from developing hypothesis to drawing conclusion.

Finding a nice restaurunt to eat is a common theme of our dietary and social lives. But to what extend do costumers' ratings about the restaurant depend on subjective factors? In this project we investigate the correlation between personal traits like marital status and smoking habit and the numeric evaluation on dining experience.
